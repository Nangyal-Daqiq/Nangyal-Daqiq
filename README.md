Web development has been so much fun for the first time ever since I built my first React project, "Game-hub". Using React Query for fetching and caching data, and Zustand for state management makes it super fast, scalable and reliable. 
I'm currently on the look out for a role in frontend web development. I'd especially love to work at a startup on a tight knit team where I can make an impact quickly. If you're hiring, let's chat!
